## Download it

After copying the URL we can start the downloading process.

First step is going to [DownloadYouTubeVideo](https://download-youtube-video.com). Use your browser and go to this url.

After opening the page, you will be greeted with a input box and a button called '**Download Now**'.

Click the input that says '**Paste your video link here**' and paste the URL you copied in there.

After that, click '**Download Now**' button and wait for a bit to let us do the magic.

After some time, you will be greeted with a panel. In that panel you should see the thumbnail of the video and **download buttons on the right**.

Those buttons are basically **quality settings** for video. Clicking a button mostly will start the download. But some systems doesn't do that, instead they open a new browser tab and starts the video.

But don't worry because in that new page, clicking the **three dot button** on the bottom right of the video and click '**Download**' button, that will start the download operation.
